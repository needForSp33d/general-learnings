## How to turn a group of strangers into a team:

Teaming = something that must take place in the workplace with increasing frequency.
Hospitals as an exemplar of informal, rapid, crisis-focused, and temporary teaming.

Many challenges simply cannot be addressed by any one individual.

It is hard to team across industry and cultural boundaries. Professional culture clash as a major barrier to delivery.

- Experimentation
- Rapid feedback
- Willing to take risks

- Leadership has to emerge:
- Situational humility + curiosity = psychological safety

- Encouraging other people to speak up.
- Supports innovation/experimentation.
- Disrupts the zero-sum mentality.

- How can we identify the unique skills and talents of those around us?
- How do we communicate what we bring to the team?
